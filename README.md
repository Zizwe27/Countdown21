This is a two player game. In this case, one of the players will be the Python program.
The game starts with 21 coins on the table.
Each player takes turns removing 1, 2, or 3 coins from the table.
If a player removes all the coins from the table on their turn, they win the game.
There's a secret strategy that a player can use to always win if they play first. So, to be fair, the human player goes first. 
The computer player will use the optimal strategy and always win if the human player does not make the winning moves.
